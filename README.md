# FPS-Game-Using-reinforcement
Its my graduation project its about using ai &amp; reinforcement learning in creating fps shooting game using Unity and C# 
This project mainly deals with the development of a 3D game application with the Unity game engine for Windows OS.
our game tells a story about a warrior who fights monsters to free the Forests From freezing cold,
the more he fights the more those monsters get smarter and more difficult to fight which is done using AI. 
monsters have the ability to freeze everything They caused the death of plants and creatures.
